## Meag Notes - HCD/biodata/research software talks at Turing and Imperial. Visit to EMBL-EBI and KDL (12-16 Sept 2022)

### BLUF
 
### People, Places, Things (non-exhaustive)
- Research Application Manager (interesting role at Turing dedicated to taking research forward)
- EDIS Wellcome Consortium
- HDRUK
- GWAS catalogue/polygenic risk score (EMBL. Ideas for WB)
- EDIS (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion in Science and Health)
- OmicsDI (access to omic datasets: https://www.omicsdi.org .. look at Discovery Index)
- CARE principles (like FAIR but for Indigenous data projects)
- BioIT Portal
- Galaxy tutorials (great way to learn genomic data science)
- Born in Bradford 20k children’s study (https://borninbradford.nhs.uk/research/)


### Learnings
- HCD in the research setting @ Turing </br>
   -  People were curious when you hire a full-time ux designer versus requiring these activities by RSEs
   -  People were also curious about methodologies/easy ways to get started
   -  Lots of agreement that PPIE and HCD have many things in common
   -  Interesting question: what is unique about patient and public involvement in the healthcare setting
- UX/UI activities in RSE @ Imperial </br>
   - Plenty of researchers still coding themselves. Often partnering with clinicians. 
   - They are building computationally complex models to predict disease but ending at the UI
   - Motivation: UI is not on the path of success for researchers. They would rather fumble in the Command Line than invest in a UI. Jeremy ends up building a crappy one to get the job done
   - There are not a lot of use cases being shared across research software development and a lot of it is unfunded/ends when the grant ends. How much legacy code is out there? Can we share the use cases? Too context specific? Or start with domain focus.
   - Researcher/PI don’t always know what problem they want to solve with RS
- RS/biodata @ EMBL-EBI </br>
   - Data is housed locally. No cloud. Researchers request access to archived data files. Hard to know what researchers do with the data afer
   - Findability is tricky. People have a gard time finding the data they want. some of the gateway work is helping. 
- PPIE panel @ Turing </br>
  - PPIE toolkit, participants as co-authors
  - Example where youth were being studied and they helped interpret the findings. their findings were different than the scientists alone.


## Ideas for What's Next
- propose a UX in RS community meet up/host a series to gauge interest for a CoP
- blog on the overlap between PPIE and HCD, and describe differences
- blog on when you should hire a UX designer
- blog on how to get started with UX on a project (baseline audit activity followed by usabliity testing)
- Methodology directory for ux activities relevant to research software processes
- Carpentries course for front-end dev (React)
- Personalized workshop based on where people are in their UX learning journey:     
    - [ ] Are not sure what it is  
    - [ ] Are not sure how to get started
    - [ ] Are not paid to do this work [is this the biggest part? Lowest hanging fruit maybe]
    - [ ] Don’t have the bandwidth to do it consistently/rigorously
