## Meag Notes - RSECon22, Day 1
### Event Details
https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/program </br>

_will update with final notes when they are shared_

### BLUF
Centering users throughout the data and software lifecycle is definitely present but doesn't always have the UX banner. When UX is present, the teams can be small. Sometimes 1 person.  

### People, Places, Things (non-exhaustive)
- State of the Browser (Ginestra is an organizer)
- DH23/24 <— Digital humanites conference that Ginestra mentioned
- Bulma, Bootstrap (front-end frameworks at KCL)
- Helix https://helixcentre.com/ (HCD lab working with Dementia Research UK)

### Learnings
- Ginestra Ferraro, UX <> Research Software Integration [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/42]) </br>
   - Started with an underlying belief that working together is better than working alone. 
   - Big problem: design is fuzzy and broad 
   - Other Problems: milestones are not synced, dependencies not defined, efficiency is lost, lack of inclusive planning, disportionate resources 
   - Solution: Workflow integration toolkit (details coming soon. This is Ginestra's SSI fellowship project)
   - Success metrics: Satisfaction of partners, workers feel less isolated.
   - Advice to RSEs: improve communication with UX team, and vice versa.
   - _I don’t think full-stack RSEs exist. The complexity is quiet high. Being good at both is a myth, you need to compromise._ [when asked about RSEs who do UX work] 
- Matt Machin, co-design [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/13)
   - Collecting requirements from users is standard practice but co-design takes this one step further, actually multiple steps further… co-design is active involvement throughout the process.
   - Bring in an independent facilitator to run co-design workshops to level the playing field
   - They teach people co-design who have not participated before. Participants include research collaboratores, users (patients in this case), and RSEs
   - Some funders are now expecting some level of co-design
   - What if you don't act on the feedback people give you? Just keep the communication clear, transparent, and ongoing. 
   - How do you relate co-design to Agile? There are different ways to bring co-design into agile depending on how frequently you can access your users. (sometimes patients attend Sprint Planning/Scrum Review meetings!)
- Dementia Research UK [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/78)
   - Projection: 1.6M in 2040 ppl w. Dementia
   - Project installs in-home sensors. Focus on a wide range of devices. Patients have tablets provided by the study with a dashboard showing their stats.
   - They built a "Living Lab" in the office. A great reminder of the environment they are working in. 
   - Challenges: Addressing the wide range of needs (but they are all interested in a USABLE system). Also some patients forfet why the sensors are there. One patient took down the sensors.
   - There's a web interface for researchers to query the DB called "Research Portal"
   - From the website: https://mindermeetingplace.com/mindsets/ ("mindsets" that sounds similar to design principles)
- Other talks that mention engaging with the community and incorporating their feedback: Equitable decision making in Smart Cities, Turing and Newcastle [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/43) & Creativity Engine [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/49)
- Misc chats on the state of ux in scientific computing  
    - When there are design teams, they are still small. Sometimes 1-2 people. Not a lot of opportunity to bounce ideas off a larger group of people.
    - Accessability is still a big challenge. Understanding and adoption of minimum WCAG standards can be difficult.
    - Some dev teams/OSS projects are looking for a checklist (accessible Y/N)
    - One reason UX may not have as much vsibility in the RSE is that some spend their career in academia and don't have industry exposure where UX is more prevelant.

## Ideas for What's Next
- In addition to mapping how UX integrates into the SLDC, map out the UX tool stack, showing which tools we use and when
- Promote Ginestra’s collaborative toolkit when it’s ready
- Host a virtual design meetup with KCL, Quantsight, Turing, and others who may be interested. Create a space for people to bounce off ideas about project work
