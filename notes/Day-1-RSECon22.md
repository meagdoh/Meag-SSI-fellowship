### Learnings
* Ginestra Ferraro, UX <> Research Software Integration [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/42]) </br>
   - Started with an underlying belief that working together is better than working alone. 
   - Big problem: design is fuzzy and broad 
   - Other Problems: milestones are not synced, dependencies not defined, efficiency is lost, lack of inclusive planning, disportionate resources 
   - Solution: Workflow integration toolkit (details coming soon. This is Ginestra's SSI fellowship project)
   - Success metrics: Satisfaction of partners, workers feel less isolated.
   - Advice to RSEs: improve communication with UX team, and vice versa.
   - _I don’t think full-stack RSEs exist. The complexity is quiet high. Being good at both is a myth, you need to compromise._ [when asked about RSEs who do UX work] 
- Matt Machin, co-design [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/13)
- Creativity Engine [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/49)

- Chat w. Tania Allard



## Ideas for What's Next
- In addition to mapping how UX integrates into the SLDC, map out the UX tool stack, showing which tools we use and when
- Promote Ginestra’s collaborative toolkit when it’s ready
