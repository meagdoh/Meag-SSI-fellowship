### Event Details

_will update with final notes when they are shared_

### BLUF
There are many efforts in community engagement, education, training and documentation that spend a thoughtful amount on what users need. UX should partner closely with those activities. 

### People, Places, Things (non-exhaustive)
- Panoptes (back end for Zooniverse)
- https://jjallaire.github.io/visualization-curriculum/
- RStudio is now called Posit
- Coding-confessions.github.io
- https://global.health/ (had a team of UX specialists)
- https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/ (phenotype library inspiration)


### Learnings
- Zooniverse [(abstract)]([https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/42]](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/112)) </br>
   -  2.5M volunteers participating in community developed citsci projects
   -  Each project has an in-contact education section built into the project description> 
   -  Engagement increases when teh researchers actively participate on the project, connecting with volunteers. 
   -  Leaders board is the worst thing you can do, the volunteers try to work more quickly to keep up and do worse work. Community challenges are better (rallying around a specific project/theme), thereâ€™s an uptick in performance.
 -  Quarto [(abstract)](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/80)
      - Packed room. There's a lot of buzz about this new tool and people wanted to test it out. 
      - The workshop was strcutured as an intro to the tool, various use cases to test out, and a feedback session at the end (great model).
      - General observation: Quarto is built by the people behind R. R users in the room had an easy time getting on and trying things out. Everyone else struggled for a majority of the session to get the tool up and running. By the end, most people in my breakout said they would not adopt this tool. Maybe wrong audience.  
-  Tutorial Driven Development [(abstract)]([https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/80](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/public/3101/submission/11))]
      - MetaWards documentation: https://metawards.org/tutorial/
      - 4 main benefits of writing the tutorial for the thing before you build it: (1) Increase robustness and reproducibility, (2) Increase flexibility and extendibility, (3) Increase learnability and usability, (4) Increase adaptability and connect-ability (few things solve this many challenges)
      - Constraints building a COVID platform: Little time to meet and learn & Changing fluid situation/requirements in flux
      - Solution: really good documentation
      - Metawards documentation. Not just the code but the science behind the code all brought into one space, where everyone met to collaborate
      - How did we make time? If nobody knows how to use it, then you have no users.
      - How does the tutorial stay in sync? THE TUTORIAL IS THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH. YOU CHANGE THE TUTORIAL FIRST, THE CODE SECOND
      - Tutorial Driven Development Manifesto: _What is the software going to be used for?_ is the first q before engaging on new projects
      - MY USERS ARE THE CI.. IF THE TUTORIAL FAILS MY USERS WILL TELL ME, REAL-WORLD INTEGRATION TESTING 
      - Is this like Literate programming/Donald Kuth? this is the inspiration.. but literate programming is more of an individual task. The tutorials are coming from the user community.

## Ideas for What's Next
- Search for an introductory Data Structures and Algorithms course for UX designers
