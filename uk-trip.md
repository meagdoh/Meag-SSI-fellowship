## UK Trip - RSECon2022 and UXRS Talk Series (Sept 6-14, 2022)


#### Trip Goals
- Meet RSE leaders who are responsible for the customer experience of research software, and find out what barriers they face and goals they have. I am still wondering, _is there anyone with the title 'Research Software Designer (RSD)'_
  - [name=Sophia B] Not their official title, but get in touch with [German Bauer](https://twitter.com/design4use) about some folks they know. 
- Share what's working and lessons learned from measuring the customer experience at _All of Us_
  - [name=Sophia B] This can be incorporated into the Open Talk if it is useful to do so. 
- Gauge interest in a CoP focused on customer experience in Research Software
  - "customers" are participants and researchers 
- Share how 'Improving the Researcher Experience' has become a key strategy for the _All of Us_ Scientific Strategy
