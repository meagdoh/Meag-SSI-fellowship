# **IDEA**
A discussion on the state of usability practices in scientific software, and how that impacts people's work. Usability practices here includes any activities you perform to make scientific software more usable.

# **REASON**
By the time of the retreat, the Superbloom team (I am a volunteer on the team) will be wrapping up and sharing new research on how usability and design presents in scientific open source software, with the goal of investigating what are the conditions that enable scientific open source teams to prioritize and focus on usability successfully.

I could present the outcomes of this initial research and then transition into a  group discussion about our own experiences on the topic.

# **OUTCOME**
A post for the SSI blog (https://www.software.ac.uk/blog) where I've been writing about software usability.

Maybe a formal or informal response to the Superbloom team about their findings and how we might apply learnings to our own work.
