#### About the event
In this seminar, we will explore how UX/UI practices are evolving alongisde the rise of RSE groups. This seminar will cover (1) a brief overview of the role of UX/UI designer in the research setting (RSDesigner), (2) a case study of UX/UI work at National Institutes of Health's *All of Us* Research Program, (3) and a call for increasing the use of UX/UI practices in RSE work. There will be time for discussion so please bring your UX/UI questions.

The *All of Us* Research Program is inviting one million or more people across the U.S. to help build one of the largest, most diverse health databases in history. By engaging the participation of people and communities who have been left out of medical research in the past and making their data available to diverse researchers across a wide range of  settings, the program seeks to improve understanding of health and disease and reduce health disparities.
