### Who is it for? Why is it good?
The audience for this proposal is anyone working in user experience, community management, or software engineering who is familiar with agile development methodologies and interested in learning how to conduct effective usability testing. Prior knowledge of usability principles and design thinking principles would be helpful.

By the end of this lightning talk, attendees should better understand how to conduct usability testing in an agile environment effectively and articulate for the value of doing so.

### About the event
Connection to CW23 themes: Usability testing and design are often seen as underinvested skills in research software engineering. Rather than becoming "another thing to do" this session aims to share knowledge about the importance of usability testing and how to execute tests on your own or with a design partner. 

### Talk Outline
Software development teams have become increasingly interested in incorporating usability testing into the software development lifecycle, but operationalizing testing can be an uphill battle. 

This session will share good practices and practical steps for conducting effective usability testing in agile environments, including identifying the right moments to conduct testing and ensuring that testing is incorporated into development cycles. We will share real-world examples of successful usability testing projects completed at a national health research program and other related projects where usability testing had an impact.
